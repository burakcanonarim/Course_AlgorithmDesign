# **Course:** Design and Analysis of Algorithms
This repository is about a lecture which is named "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" at Mugla Sitki Kocman University.

In this repository, the program accepts an unsorted input file of numbers as input. Also each number has to be separated by EOL.

My program inserts the numbers one by one into an AVL tree and prints how long the insertion of all numbers takes. Then program reads the same file again for insertion the numbers into LinkedList and prints how long the insertion of all numbers takes. Afterwards, the program reads the same file finally for deletion all numbers one by one from the AVL tree with keeping AVL rules. Also program prints how long it takes deleting all of them.
